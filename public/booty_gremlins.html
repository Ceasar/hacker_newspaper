    Site down for unknown reasons. Check
    <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> instead.

  <p>
    Hacker Newspaper has minor stability issues due to flaws in the Hacker News RSS
    feed, as well as the limitations of this site itself (which is a fairly simple hack).

  <p>
    <span class="highlight">
    The process which generates Hacker Newspaper will run again automatically within an
    hour.</span> Most Hacker Newspaper stability issues resolve themselves within that time
    frame, and personally I (Giles, the site's creator) read Hacker News way too freaking
    often anyway.
