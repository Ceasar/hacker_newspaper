my Google Analytics is hard-coded in here. please adjust if you deploy your own version!

also, this code is pretty vulnerable to fluctuations in the RSS feed from Hacker News. there's no doubt that Y Combinator has unleashed some terrific tech on the world, but in my personal opinion, that can't really include the nested tables and flaky RSS of Hacker News.
